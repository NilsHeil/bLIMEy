# build LIME yourself (bLIMEy) #

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks that can be used to reproduce
experiments included in various manuscripts discussing surrogate explanations
of black-box predictions (bLIMEy). The list of manuscripts is enclosed below.

## bLIMEy: Surrogate Prediction Explanations Beyond LIME ##

* The manuscripts available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13016).
* Experiments available in the [HCML 2019 directory](https://github.com/So-Cool/bLIMEy/tree/master/HCML_2019).
